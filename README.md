**It shows:**  
**[Singleplayer]**  
game icon, current weapon icon, current mission, progress (in percentage), in-game days passed(when you hover over the game icon) and current location (when you hover over the weapon icon).  
  
**[SA-MP]**  
samp icon, current weapon icon, your nickname[id], current server, current location (when you hover over the weapon icon).  
  
**Just like any other ASI plugin, you are gonna need an ASI loader to use this one.**
